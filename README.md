The template engine for this Node.js RESTful API application is Handlebars.js, the database is MySQL, and Sequelize ORM is used for data modeling. The application provides express-session and cookie-based authentication, as well as GET and POST routes for obtaining and adding new data. Environment variables are used to protect sensitive data and API keys.

## Motivation
A strong, secure, and dependable RESTful API that can be utilized by a variety of web and mobile applications was the driving force behind the development of this service! The program adheres to best practices and industry standards and offers developers a flexible design that makes it simple to integrate it into their applications.

## Design Process

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design approach was used to create the application. The model represents the data structure and business logic, and the view represents the user interface. The controller controls communication between these two components. The application was meant to be responsive and entertaining to provide users the best experience possible.

## Technologies Used

```md
The following technologies were used in the development of this application:

Node.js: An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance applications.
Express.js: A flexible and lightweight Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
Handlebars.js: A popular templating engine that allows developers to create dynamic HTML templates easily.
MySQL: An open-source relational database management system that provides a scalable and reliable way to store and retrieve data.
Sequelize ORM: A popular Node.js ORM that allows developers to interact with relational databases using JavaScript.
express-session: A middleware that provides session support for Express.js applications.
cookies: A middleware that provides cookie support for Express.js applications.
dotenv: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
```
## Demonstration
The application includes both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data. The application also includes authentication using express-session and cookies, and API keys and sensitive information are protected with environment variables. The application is also responsive and interactive to provide an optimal user experience.

## Future Development
Some possible future developments for this application include adding more features and functionality, improving the UI/UX, optimizing performance, and expanding support for more database management systems.
